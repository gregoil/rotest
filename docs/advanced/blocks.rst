========================
Blocks code architecture
========================

Background
==========

The blocks design paradigm was created to avoid code duplication and enable
composing tests faster.

``TestBlock`` is a building block for tests, commonly responsible for a single
action or a small set of actions.
It inherits from :mod:`unittest`'s :class:`TestCase <unittest.TestCase>`,
enabling it test-like behavior (``self.skipTest``, ``self.assertEqual``,
``self.fail``, etc.), and the Rotest infrastructure expands its behavior to
also be function-like (to have "inputs" and "outputs").

``TestFlow`` is a test composed of ``TestBlock`` instances (or other sub-test
flows), passing them their 'inputs' and putting them together, enabling them
to share data between each other.
A ``TestFlow`` can lock resources much like Rotest's TestCase, which it
passes to all the blocks under it.

The flow's final result depends on the result of the blocks under it by the
following order:

* If some block had an error, the flow ends with an error.
* If some block had a failure, the flow ends with a failure.
* Otherwise, the flow succeeds.

See also ``mode`` in the ``TestBlock``'s "Features" segment below for more
information about the run mechanism of a ``TestFlow``.

Features
========

TestFlow
--------

#. ``blocks``: static list or tuple of the blocks' classes of the flow. You
   can parametrize blocks in this section, in order to pass data to them (see
   `Sharing data`_ section or explanation in the TestBlock features section).

#. Rotest's ``TestCase`` features: run delta, filter by tags, running in
   multiprocess, TIMEOUT, etc. are available also for ``TestFlow`` class.

TestBlock
---------

#. ``inputs``: define class fields and assign them to instances of BlockInput
    to ask for values for the block (values are passed via ``common``,
    ``parametrize``, previous blocks passing them as ``outputs``, or as
    requested resources of the block or its containers).
    You can define a default value to BlockInput to assign if none is supplied
    (making it an optional input). For example, defining in the block's scope

   .. code-block:: python

       from rotest.core import TestBlock, BlockInput
       class DemoBlock(TestBlock):
           field_name = BlockInput()
           other_field = BlockInput(default=1)
       ...

   will validate that the block instance will have a value for 'field_name'
   before running the parent flow (and unless another value is supplied,
   set for the block's instance: self.other_field=1). The static validation
   would also make sure that the parameters passed to blocks (via ``parametrize``
   or ``common``) exist as inputs, to help avoiding syntactic errors and stale code.

#. ``outputs``: define class fields and assign them to instances of BlockOutput
    to share values from the instance (self) to the parent and siblings.
    the block automatically shares the declared outputs after teardown.
    For example, defining in the block's scope

   .. code-block:: python

       from rotest.core import TestBlock, BlockOutput
       class DemoBlock(TestBlock):
           field_name = BlockOutput()
           other_field = BlockOutput()
       ...

   means declaring that the block would calculate a values for self.field_name
   and self.other_field and share them (which happens automatically after its
   teardown), so that components following the block can use those fields.
   Declaring inputs and outputs of blocks is not mandatory, but it's a good way
   to make sure that the blocks "click" together properly, and no block will be
   missing fields at runtime.

Common features (for both flows and blocks)
-------------------------------------------

#. ``resources``: you can specify resources for the test flow or block, just
   like in Rotest's TestCase class.
   The resources of a flow will automatically propagate to the components under
   it.

#. ``common``: used to set values to blocks or sub-flows, see example in the
   `Sharing data`_ section.

#. ``parametrize`` (also ``params``): used to pass values to blocks or
   sub-flows, see example in the `Sharing data`_ section.
   Note that calling ``parametrize()`` or ``params()`` doesn't actually
   instantiate the component, but just create a copy of the class and sends
   the parameters to its common (overriding previous values).

#. ``mode``: this field can be defined statically in the component's class or
   passed to the instance using 'parametrize' (parametrized fields override
   class fields of blocks, since they are injected into the instance).
   Blocks and sub-flows can run in one of the following modes (which are
   defined in :mod:`rotest.core.flow_component`)

   #. ``MODE_CRITICAL``: upon failure or error, end the flow's run, skipping
      the following components (except those with mode ``MODE_FINALLY``).
      Use this mode for blocks or sub-flows that do actions that are mandatory
      for the continuation of the test.
   #. ``MODE_OPTIONAL``: upon error only, end the flow's run, skipping the
      following components (except those with mode ``MODE_FINALLY``). Use this
      mode for block or sub-flows that are not critical for the continuation of
      the test (since a failure in them doesn't stop the flow).
   #. ``MODE_FINALLY``: components with this mode aren't skipped even if the
      flow has already failed and stopped. Upon failure or error, end the
      flow's run, skipping the following components (except those with mode
      ``MODE_FINALLY``).
      Use this mode for example in blocks or sub-flows that do cleanup actions
      (which we should always attempt), much like things you would normally put
      in 'tearDown' of tests.

#. ``request_resources``: blocks and flows can dynamically request resources,
   calling ``request_resources(requests)`` method (see Rotest tutorial and
   documentation for more information).

   Since those are dynamic requests, don't forget to release those resources
   when they are not needed by calling

   .. code-block:: python

       release_resources(<list of the dynamically locked resource names>)

   Resources can be locked locally and globally in regarding to the containing
   flow, i.e. by locking the resources using the parent's method:

   .. code-block:: python

       self.parent.request_resources(requests)

   The parent flow and all the sibling components would also have them.

Sharing data
------------

Sharing data between blocks (getting inputs and passing outputs) is crucial to
writing simple, manageable, and independent blocks.
Passing data to blocks (for them to use as 'inputs' parameters for the block's
run, much like arguments for a function) can be done in one of the following
methods:

* Locking resources - the resources the flow locks are injected into its
  components' instances (note that blocks can also lock resources, but they
  don't propagate them up or down).
  E.g. if a flow locks a resource with name 'res1', then all its components
  would have the field 'res1' which points to the locked resource.

* Declaring outputs - see TestBlock's ``outputs`` above.

* Setting initial data to the test - you can set initial data to the
  component and its sub-components by writing:

  .. code-block:: python

      class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
          common = {'field_name': 5,
                    'other_field': 'abc'}
      ...

  This will inject ``field_name=5`` and ``other_field='abc'`` as fields of the
  flow and its components before starting its run, so the blocks would also
  have access to those fields.
  Note that you can also declare a ``common`` dict for blocks, but it's
  generally recommended to use default values for inputs instead.

* Using parametrize - you can specify fields for blocks or flows by calling
  their 'parametrize' or 'params' class method.

  For example:

  .. code-block:: python

      class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
          blocks = (DemoBlock,
                    DemoBlock.parametrize(field_name=5,
                                          other_field='abc'))

  will create two blocks under the ``DemoFlow``, one ``DemoBlock`` block with
  the default values for ``field_name`` and ``other_field`` (which can be set
  by defining them as class fields for the block for example, see optional
  inputs and fields section), and a second ``DemoBlock`` with ``field_name=5``
  and ``other_field='abc'`` injected into the block instance (at runtime).

  Regarding priorities hierarchy between the methods, it follows two rules:

  #. For a single component, calling ``parametrize`` on it overrides the
     values set through ``common``.

  #. ``common`` and ``parametrize`` of sub-components are stronger than
     the values passed by containing hierarchies.
     E.g. ``common`` values of a flow are of lower priority than the
     ``parametrize`` values passed to the blocks under it.


Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    from rotest.core import TestBlock, BlockInput, BlockOutput
    class DoSomethingBlock(TestBlock):
        """A block that does something.

        Attributes:
            resource1 (object): resource the block uses.
            input2 (object): input for the block.
            optional3 (object): optional input for the block.
        """
        mode = MODE_CRITICAL

        resource1 = BlockInput()
        input2 = BlockInput()
        optional3 = BlockInput(default=0)

        output1 = BlockOutput()

        def test_method(self):
            self.logger.info("Doing something")
            value = self.resource1.do_something(self.input2, self.optional3)
            self.output1 = value * 5  # This will be shared with siblings

    ...

    class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
        resource1 = SomeResourceClass(some_limitation=LIMITATION)

        common = {'input2': INPUT_VALUE}

        blocks = (DemoBlock1,
                  DemoBlock2,
                  DemoBlock1,
                  DoSomethingBlock.params(optional3=5),
                  DoSomethingBlock,
                  DemoBlock1.params(mode=MODE_FINALLY))

Sub-flows
---------

A flow may contain not only test-block, but also test-flows under it. This
feature can be used to wrap together blocks that tend to come together and also
to create sub-procedures (if a test block is comparable to a simple
function - it may have inputs and outputs and does a simple action, then a
sub-flow can be considered a complex function, which invokes other simpler
functions).
Note that a sub-flow behaves exactly like a block, meaning, you can call
parametrize on it, set a mode to it, it can't be filtered or skipped with
delta, etc.
This can give extra flexibility when composing flows with complex scenarios,
for example:

.. code-block:: none

    Flow
    |___BlockA
    |___BlockB
    |___BlockC
    |___BlockD

If you want that block B will only run if block A passed, and that block D will
only run if block C passed, but also to keep A and C not dependent, doing so is
impossible without the usage of sub flows.
But the scenario can be coded in the following manner:

.. code-block:: none

    Flow
    |___SubFlow1 (mode optional)
        |___BlockA (mode critical)
        |___BlockB (mode critical)
    |___SubFlow2 (mode optional)
        |___BlockC (mode critical)
        |___BlockD (mode critical)

Common *mistakes* when writing sub-flows:

* Flows can't declare inputs and outputs, only blocks can.
  They can, however, declare `mode` and `common` and be parametrized.

* Declared or imported sub-flows will be caught by the Rotest tests discoverer,
  than means that it will also try to run then separately. To avoid that,
  can either use --filter to run only specific flows or declare the sub-flows
  abstract using `__test__ = False`:


.. code-block:: python

    from rotest.core import TestFlow, create_flow, MODE_CRITICAL, MODE_OPTIONAL

    class DemoSubFlow(TestFlow):
        __test__ = False

        mode = MODE_OPTIONAL

        blocks = (DemoBlock1,
                  DemoBlock2,
                  DemoBlock1)


    class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
        resource1 = SomeResourceClass(some_limitation=LIMITATION)

        blocks = (DemoSubFlow,
                  DemoSubFlow.params(input1=3),
                  DemoSubFlow.params(mode=MODE_OPTIONAL))


Anonymous test-flows
--------------------

Sub-flows can be created on-the-spot using the 'create_flow' function, to avoid
defining classes.
The functions gets the following arguments:

* ``blocks`` - list of the flow's components.

* ``name`` - name of the flow, default value is "AnonymousTestFlow", but it's
  recommended to override it.

* ``mode`` - mode of the new flow.
  Either ``MODE_CRITICAL``, ``MODE_OPTIONAL`` or ``MODE_FINALLY``. Default is
  ``MODE_CRITICAL``.

* ``common`` - dict of initial fields and values for the new flow, same as the
  class variable 'common', default is empty dict.

.. code-block:: python

    from rotest.core.flow import TestFlow, create_flow

    class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
        resource1 = SomeResourceClass(some_limitation=LIMITATION)

        blocks = (DemoBlock1,
                  DemoBlock2,
                  DemoBlock1,
                  create_flow(name="TestSomethingFlow",
                              common={"input2": "value1"}
                              mode=MODE_OPTIONAL,
                              blocks=[DoSomethingBlock,
                                      DoSomethingBlock.params(optional3=5)]),
                  create_flow(name="TestAnotherThingFlow",
                              common={"input2": "value2"}
                              mode=MODE_OPTIONAL,
                              blocks=[DoSomethingBlock,
                                      DoSomethingBlock.params(optional3=5)]),
                  DemoBlock1.params(mode=MODE_FINALLY))

Pipes
-----

Since blocks are meant to be generic, sometimes the naming of their outputs and
inputs won't align with other (more proprietary) blocks.

``Pipe`` is the solution to this problem. With it, you can:

  * Redirect values into blocks' inputs.

  * Rename blocks' outputs.

  * Adjust or transform values.

Consider the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    from rotest.core import TestBlock, TestFlow, BlockInput, BlockOutput


    class DoSomethingBlock(TestBlock):
        output1 = BlockOutput()

        def test_method(self):
            self.output1 = 5

    class ValidateSomethingBlock(TestBlock):
        input1 = BlockInput()

        def test_method(self):
            self.assertEqual(self.input1, 6)


    class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
        blocks = (DoSomethingBlock,
                  ValidateSomethingBlock)


The flow above can't run, since the blocks under `DemoFlow` don't connect
properly - `ValidateSomethingBlock` doesn't get its required input.

But we can redirect `input1` to `output1` using ``Pipe`` in one of the following ways:

.. code-block:: python

    from rotest.core import TestFlow, Pipe


    class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
        blocks = (DoSomethingBlock.params(output1=Pipe('input1')),
                  ValidateSomethingBlock)


.. code-block:: python

    from rotest.core import TestFlow, Pipe


    class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
        blocks = (DoSomethingBlock,
                  ValidateSomethingBlock.params(input1=Pipe('output1')))


.. code-block:: python

    from rotest.core import TestFlow, Pipe


    class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
        common = {'input1': Pipe('output1')}

        blocks = (DoSomethingBlock,
                  ValidateSomethingBlock)


.. code-block:: python

    from rotest.core import TestFlow, Pipe


    class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
        common = {'output1': Pipe('input1')}

        blocks = (DoSomethingBlock,
                  ValidateSomethingBlock)


Note that the use of ``common`` applies the pipe to all the blocks under the flow,
and it overrides both `BlockInput` and `BlockOutput` instances with the given name.

Furthermore, we can manipulate values using ``Pipe``
(this can be done both to inputs and outputs):

.. code-block:: python

    from rotest.core import TestFlow, Pipe


    class DemoFlow(TestFlow):
        blocks = (DoSomethingBlock.params(output1=Pipe('input1', formula=lambda x: x+1)),
                  ValidateSomethingBlock)


In the example above, at the end of `DoSomethingBlock` two things would happen:
* `output1` 's value will be transformed using the formula - from 5 to 6.
* `output1` will change its name to `input1` before being shared.
