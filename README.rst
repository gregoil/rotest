Rotest is a resource oriented testing framework, for writing system or
integration tests.

Rotest is based on Python's `unittest` module and on the Django framework.
It enables defining simple abstracted components in the system, called
resources. The resources may be DUT (devices under test) or they may help
the test process. The tests look very much like tests written using the
builtin module `unittest`.

Why Use Rotest?
===============
- Allowing teams to share resources without interfering with one another.
- Easily abstracting automated components in the system.
- Lots of useful features: multiprocess, filtering tests, variety of output
  handlers (and the ability to create custom ones), and much more.

Examples
========
For a complete step-by-step explanation about the framework, you can read
our documentation at `Read The Docs <http://rotest.rtfd.io>`_. If you just want
to see how it looks, read further.

For our example, let's look at an example for a ``Calculator`` resource:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import rpyc
    from django.db import models
    from rotest.management.models import resource_data
    from rotest.management import base_resource


    class CalculatorData(resource_data.ResourceData):
        class Meta:
            app_label = "resources"

        ip_address = models.IPAddressField()


    class Calculator(base_resource.BaseResource):
        DATA_CLASS = CalculatorData

        PORT = 1357
        EXECUTABLE_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"),
                                       "calc.py")

        def connect(self):
            self._rpyc = rpyc.classic.connect(self.data.ip_address,
                                              self.PORT)

        def calculate(self, expression):
            result = self._rpyc.modules.subprocess.check_output(
                ["python", self.EXECUTABLE_PATH, expression])
            return int(result.strip())

        def finalize(self):
            if self._rpyc is not None:
                self._rpyc.close()
                self._rpyc = None

The ``CalculatorData`` class is a standard Django model that exposes IP
address of the calculator machine through the data attribute.
Also, we're using `rpyc` for automating the access to those machines. Except
from that, it's easy to notice how the `connect` method is making the
connection to the machine, and how the `finalize` method is cleaning
afterwards.

Now, an example for a test:

.. code-block:: python

    from rotest import main
    from rotest.core import TestCase


    class SimpleCalculationTest(TestCase):
        calculator = Calculator()

        def test_simple_calculation(self):
            self.assertEqual(self.calculator.calculate("1+2"), 3)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

The test may include the ``setUp`` and ``tearDown`` methods of `unittest` as
well, and it differs only in the request for resources.

Following, those are the options exposed when running the test:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rotest -h
    Run tests in a module or directory.

    Usage:
        rotest [<path>...] [options]

    Options:
        -h,  --help
                Show help message and exit.
        --version
                Print version information and exit.
        -c <path>, --config <path>
                Test configuration file path.
        -s, --save-state
                Enable saving state of resources.
        -d <delta-iterations>, --delta <delta-iterations>
                Enable run of failed tests only - enter the number of times the
                failed tests should be run.
        -p <processes>, --processes <processes>
                Use multiprocess test runner - specify number of worker
                processes to be created.
        -o <outputs>, --outputs <outputs>
                Output handlers separated by comma.
        -f <query>, --filter <query>
                Run only tests that match the filter expression,
                e.g. 'Tag1* and not Tag13'.
        -n <name>, --name <name>
                Assign a name for current launch.
        -l, --list
                Print the tests hierarchy and quit.
        -F, --failfast
                Stop the run on first failure.
        -D, --debug
                Enter ipdb debug mode upon any test exception.
        -S, --skip-init
                Skip initialization and validation of resources.
        -r <query>, --resources <query>
                Specify resources to request by attributes,
                e.g. '-r res1.group=QA,res2.comment=CI'.
